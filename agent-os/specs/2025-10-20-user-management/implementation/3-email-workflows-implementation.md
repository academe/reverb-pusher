# Task 3: Email Workflows

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #3 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-20-user-management/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement user invitation and password reset email functionality. When creating users without passwords, send invitation emails. Add a "Send Password Reset Email" action to the edit user page. Ensure email_verified toggle properly controls the email_verified_at timestamp.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented the complete email workflow system for user management. The solution allows admins to create users without passwords (triggering automatic invitation emails) or with passwords (no email sent). Added a password reset email action button to the EditUser page for manual password reset email sending. The email_verified toggle (previously implemented in Task Group 2) was verified to work correctly.

The implementation leverages Laravel Breeze's existing password reset infrastructure, including the Password facade for token generation and the User model's sendPasswordResetNotification method. No custom email templates were created; all emails use Laravel's default password reset templates. To handle the database constraint requiring a non-null password field, users created without passwords are automatically assigned a random 32-character bcrypt hash, ensuring they can only access the system via the password reset link sent in the invitation email.

## Key Implementation Details

### User Creation with Invitation Email
**Location:** `app/Filament/Admin/Resources/UserResource/Pages/CreateUser.php`

Implemented two lifecycle hooks to handle the invitation email workflow:

1. **mutateFormDataBeforeCreate()**: Intercepts form data before user creation. If no password is provided, generates a random 32-character password and hashes it. This satisfies the database NOT NULL constraint on the password field while ensuring the temporary password cannot be guessed.

2. **afterCreate()**: Executes after user is created. Checks if the original form data had an empty password field. If true, generates a password reset token using `Password::createToken($this->record)` and sends the invitation email via `$this->record->sendPasswordResetNotification($token)`.

**Rationale:** This approach reuses Laravel Breeze's password reset system as an invitation mechanism, avoiding custom email templates while meeting the requirement. The random password ensures users created without passwords must use the emailed link to set their password.

### Password Reset Email Action
**Location:** `app/Filament/Admin/Resources/UserResource/Pages/EditUser.php`

Added a custom action to the header actions array:

```php
Actions\Action::make('sendPasswordReset')
    ->label('Send Password Reset Email')
    ->icon('heroicon-o-envelope')
    ->action(function () {
        $token = Password::createToken($this->record);
        $this->record->sendPasswordResetNotification($token);
        Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('Password reset email sent')
            ->send();
    })
```

This action appears alongside the Delete action, allowing admins to manually trigger password reset emails for existing users.

**Rationale:** Provides admins with a convenient way to help users who have forgotten passwords or need to reset their credentials, using the same Breeze infrastructure as user invitations.

### Password Field Validation Updates
**Location:** `app/Filament/Admin/Resources/UserResource.php`

Changed password field validation from:
```php
->required(fn ($livewire) => $livewire instanceof Pages\CreateUser)
```

To:
```php
->requiredWith('password_confirmation')
```

And password_confirmation from:
```php
->required(fn ($livewire, Forms\Get $get) => $livewire instanceof Pages\CreateUser || filled($get('password')))
```

To:
```php
->requiredWith('password')
```

**Rationale:** Makes passwords truly optional on user creation (enabling invitation workflow) while maintaining validation integrity. If either password field is filled, both must be filled and must match via the confirmed() rule.

## Database Changes
No database migrations were created. The implementation works within the existing schema constraints.

**Schema Consideration:** The users.password column has a NOT NULL constraint. Rather than modifying the database schema (which is outside the api-engineer's responsibilities), the implementation generates a secure random password when none is provided, then sends an invitation email. This approach:
- Maintains database integrity
- Ensures invited users cannot access the system without using the reset link
- Avoids cross-role responsibility boundaries

## Dependencies
No new dependencies were added. All functionality uses existing Laravel Breeze infrastructure:
- `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Password` - Token generation
- `Illuminate\Auth\Notifications\ResetPassword` - Email notification
- `Illuminate\Support\Str` - Random string generation

## Testing

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Backend API Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The implementation follows RESTful principles by extending Filament's resource pages which handle HTTP requests appropriately. The sendPasswordReset action uses standard HTTP POST semantics. The implementation returns appropriate success notifications (200-equivalent UI feedback) when emails are sent successfully.

**Deviations:** None

### Global Coding Style Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Code uses descriptive function and variable names (`mutateFormDataBeforeCreate`, `sendPasswordReset`, `$token`). Functions are small and focused on single responsibilities (separate hooks for data mutation and email sending). Comments explain the "why" (invitation email purpose, database constraint workaround) rather than the obvious "what". No dead code or unused imports.

**Deviations:** None

### Global Error Handling Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Laravel's Password facade and notification system handle errors internally. Success notifications provide clear, user-friendly feedback ("Password reset email sent"). The implementation fails fast by checking for empty password early in the workflow.

**Deviations:** None - Error handling is delegated to Laravel's robust notification system which already implements retry logic and error logging.

### Global Validation Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All validation occurs server-side in Filament form definitions. Email validation ensures proper format. Password fields use `requiredWith` to enforce mutual dependency. The `confirmed()` rule validates password confirmation matches. Validation messages are field-specific and clear.

**Deviations:** None

### Testing Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Wrote exactly 4 focused tests covering only critical email workflow paths. Tests focus on behavior (emails sent vs. not sent) rather than implementation details. Tests use Notification::fake() to mock external dependencies. Each test has a clear, descriptive name explaining what's being tested.

**Deviations:** None - Strictly followed the "write minimal tests" guideline with only 4 tests for core user flows.

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
- Filament Livewire endpoints for CreateUser and EditUser pages handle form submission and action execution
- Uses standard Filament resource routing: `/admin/users/create`, `/admin/users/{id}/edit`

### External Services
- Laravel Mail system (configured in application) sends emails via configured mail driver
- Uses Laravel's queue system if configured (email sending can be deferred to queue workers)

### Internal Dependencies
- **Password Facade** (`Illuminate\Support\Facades\Password`): Token generation and validation
- **User Model** (`App\Models\User`): Notifiable trait provides sendPasswordResetNotification method
- **Filament Notification System**: UI feedback for successful email sends
- **Laravel Breeze**: Password reset email templates and routing

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified

### Limitations

1. **Temporary Random Password**
   - Description: Users created without passwords receive a random bcrypt hash to satisfy database constraints
   - Reason: The users.password column is NOT NULL, and changing the schema is outside api-engineer responsibilities
   - Future Consideration: Database-engineer could make password nullable in a future migration if desired

2. **No Email Delivery Confirmation**
   - Description: Implementation assumes emails are successfully delivered; no tracking of bounce/failure
   - Reason: Email delivery tracking requires additional infrastructure (webhooks, monitoring service)
   - Future Consideration: Could integrate with email service provider APIs for delivery status tracking

3. **Token Expiration**
   - Description: Password reset tokens expire based on Laravel configuration (default: 60 minutes)
   - Reason: Using Laravel Breeze defaults; no custom expiration logic implemented
   - Future Consideration: Could add custom token expiration for invitation vs. reset scenarios

## Performance Considerations
Email sending is synchronous by default, which may add latency to user creation. For production environments with high user creation volume, consider:
- Configuring Laravel to queue email notifications
- Using a dedicated mail queue worker
- Monitoring email queue depth and processing time

The implementation uses Laravel's built-in notification system which is production-ready and performant.

## Security Considerations
- Random passwords use 32-character strings (bcrypt hashed), making them cryptographically secure and unguessable
- Password reset tokens are generated using Laravel's secure token generation (`Password::createToken`)
- Tokens are single-use and time-limited (configured in `config/auth.php`)
- Email addresses are validated before user creation, preventing malformed email submissions
- Invitation emails are only sent to the email address in the user record (no email override possible)

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
Task Group 4 (Protection Logic) depends on this implementation:
- Protection logic will build upon the email workflows to ensure admins cannot lock themselves out
- SendPasswordReset action may need protection to prevent abuse

## Notes

**Implementation Decision: Random Password Strategy**
The decision to generate random passwords for invited users (rather than making the password field nullable) was driven by:
1. Staying within api-engineer role boundaries (database changes belong to database-engineer)
2. Maintaining backward compatibility with existing authentication logic
3. Ensuring invited users cannot access the system without using the invitation link
4. Avoiding potential null pointer issues in authentication middleware

This approach is secure and maintainable, though a future refactor could make passwords nullable if the team prefers that architecture.

**Email Template Reuse**
Successfully reused Laravel Breeze's password reset email template for invitations. The same template serves both purposes appropriately, as both workflows lead users to the same password reset form. No custom templates needed.

**Testing Approach**
Used `Notification::fake()` to test email sending without actually sending emails during tests. This makes tests fast and deterministic while still validating that the correct notification is sent to the correct user.
