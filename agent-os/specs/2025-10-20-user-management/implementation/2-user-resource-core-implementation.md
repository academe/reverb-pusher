# Task 2: UserResource and Basic Pages

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #2 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-20-user-management/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement the core UserResource functionality in Filament Admin Panel, including form configuration, table display, and basic CRUD pages (List, Create, Edit) for user management. This establishes the foundation for all subsequent user management features.

## Implementation Summary
I successfully implemented a complete UserResource following the established ReverbAppResource patterns. The implementation includes a comprehensive form with three logical sections (Account Details, Security, Status), a table view with search/filter capabilities, and three page classes for CRUD operations. The resource integrates seamlessly with Filament's navigation and provides proper validation, particularly for email uniqueness and password requirements. The email_verified toggle properly controls the email_verified_at timestamp through a reactive form setup with a hidden field for persistence.

All four tests pass successfully, validating user creation, updates, deletion, and email uniqueness enforcement. The implementation follows Filament best practices and maintains consistency with existing resources in the codebase.

## Key Implementation Details

### UserResource Form Configuration
**Location:** `c:\Users\jason\Herd\reverb-pusher\app\Filament\Admin\Resources\UserResource.php` (lines 23-84)

The form is organized into three logical sections following the ReverbAppResource pattern:

1. **Account Details Section**: Contains name and email fields. Email has email validation, uniqueness check (ignoring current record on edit), and maxLength constraint.

2. **Security Section**: Password fields with reveal functionality. Password is required only on create (checked via `$livewire instanceof Pages\CreateUser`), has minimum length of 8 characters, requires confirmation, and is properly hashed via `dehydrateStateUsing` before storage. The password_confirmation field is marked as `dehydrated(false)` so it's never saved to the database.

3. **Status Section**: Contains active toggle (default true) and email_verified toggle. The email_verified toggle uses `reactive()` and `afterStateUpdated()` to control a hidden `email_verified_at` field, which stores the actual timestamp (now() or null) based on the toggle state.

**Rationale:** This three-section approach provides clear organization and follows the established pattern from ReverbAppResource. The password handling ensures security through proper hashing and validation, while the email_verified implementation provides a user-friendly toggle that maps to the database timestamp field.

### Table Configuration with Search and Filters
**Location:** `c:\Users\jason\Herd\reverb-pusher\app\Filament\Admin\Resources\UserResource.php` (lines 87-127)

Implemented comprehensive table display with:
- Name and email columns: searchable, sortable, with email being copyable
- Active status: IconColumn with boolean display
- Email verified: IconColumn with boolean display using `getStateUsing()` to check if `email_verified_at !== null`
- Created at: sortable datetime column
- TernaryFilter for active status (All/Active/Inactive)
- Edit and Delete actions (protection logic to be added in Task Group 4)
- Bulk delete action (protection logic to be added in Task Group 4)
- Default sort by created_at descending

**Rationale:** This configuration provides admins with powerful tools to find, view, and manage users efficiently. The copyable email feature improves UX when needing to communicate with users. The TernaryFilter allows quick filtering by active status, which will be crucial for managing user access.

### EditUser Page with Email Verified State Handling
**Location:** `c:\Users\jason\Herd\reverb-pusher\app\Filament\Admin\Resources\UserResource\Pages\EditUser.php` (lines 18-24)

Implemented `mutateFormDataBeforeFill()` to properly set the email_verified toggle state when loading an existing user record. This converts the database timestamp to a boolean that the toggle can display.

**Rationale:** Without this method, the email_verified toggle would always show as unchecked when editing a user, even if they have a verified email. This ensures the form accurately reflects the current state of the user record.

### Test Suite for UserResource
**Location:** `c:\Users\jason\Herd\reverb-pusher\tests\Feature\UserResourceTest.php`

Created 4 focused tests covering:
1. User creation with all required fields (name, email, password, password_confirmation, active)
2. User update functionality (name and email changes)
3. User deletion
4. Email uniqueness validation (duplicate email shows form error)

All tests use Livewire testing utilities to interact with Filament pages and verify database state.

**Rationale:** These tests cover the critical CRUD operations and key validation rules without being exhaustive. They validate that the core functionality works as expected and will catch regressions in future development.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

---

### agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
**File Reference:** `c:\Users\jason\Herd\reverb-pusher\agent-os\standards\global\coding-style.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The code uses meaningful names (UserResource, ListUsers, CreateUser, EditUser), follows Laravel/Filament naming conventions, maintains consistent indentation, and keeps functions small and focused. No dead code or commented blocks were added. All code follows the DRY principle by leveraging Filament's base classes and reusing patterns from ReverbAppResource.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

---

### agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md
**File Reference:** Referenced but implementation follows established Filament and Laravel conventions

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Followed Filament resource naming conventions, used appropriate namespaces, and maintained consistency with existing resource structure (ReverbAppResource pattern).

**Deviations (if any):**
None

---

### agent-os/standards/global/validation.md
**File Reference:** Referenced for form validation implementation

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Implemented comprehensive validation including required fields, email format validation, unique email constraint (with ignoreRecord for updates), minimum password length (8 characters), password confirmation, and maxLength constraints. All validation uses Filament's built-in validation methods.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

---

### agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md
**File Reference:** Referenced for test implementation

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Wrote exactly 4 focused tests as instructed (within the 4-6 maximum), covering core CRUD operations and critical validation (email uniqueness). Tests are minimal but comprehensive for the current task scope, focusing only on what was implemented in this task group.

**Deviations (if any):**
None

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### APIs/Endpoints
Filament automatically registers the following routes for UserResource:
- `GET /admin/users` - ListUsers page (index)
- `GET /admin/users/create` - CreateUser page
- `GET /admin/users/{record}/edit` - EditUser page

These routes are protected by Filament's authentication middleware and require an active user to access.

### External Services
None in this task. Email services will be integrated in Task Group 3.

### Internal Dependencies
- **User Model** (`App\Models\User`): The resource operates on this model, which was updated in Task Group 1 with active field support
- **Filament Panel**: The resource integrates with Filament's admin panel navigation and authentication
- **Database**: Users table with columns: name, email, password, active, email_verified_at, created_at

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified.

### Limitations
1. **No Protection Logic Yet**
   - Description: Delete and edit actions don't yet prevent self-deletion or last-user deletion
   - Impact: Admins could potentially delete themselves or the last active user
   - Reason: Protection logic is intentionally deferred to Task Group 4
   - Future Consideration: Task Group 4 will add UserPolicy and action hooks for protection

2. **No Email Workflow Yet**
   - Description: No invitation emails sent when creating users without passwords
   - Impact: Users created without passwords cannot log in until password is manually set
   - Reason: Email workflows are intentionally deferred to Task Group 3
   - Future Consideration: Task Group 3 will add invitation email functionality

## Performance Considerations
The table includes database indexes on the active column (added in Task Group 1) which will optimize filtering operations. Email and name are searchable, leveraging existing database indexes on the email column. Default sorting by created_at uses the database index on that column.

## Security Considerations
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage via the dehydrateStateUsing callback
- Email uniqueness is enforced at both form validation and database constraint levels
- Password confirmation is required to prevent typos
- The password_confirmation field is never persisted to the database (dehydrated: false)
- Panel access control leverages Filament's authentication middleware and the User model's canAccessPanel() method which checks active status

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- **Task Group 3** depends on this implementation for adding email workflows to CreateUser and EditUser pages
- **Task Group 4** depends on this implementation for adding protection logic to delete actions and active toggle
- **Task Group 5** can proceed once Tasks 3 and 4 are complete
- **Task Group 6** will test all functionality integrated across task groups

## Notes
The implementation closely followed the ReverbAppResource pattern as specified, ensuring consistency across the admin panel. The email_verified toggle implementation required special handling with a hidden field and state mutation in EditUser to properly bridge between the boolean UI control and the timestamp database field. This approach provides a better user experience than directly editing a datetime field while maintaining data integrity.

The password handling logic ensures passwords are required on create but optional on edit, allowing admins to update user details without necessarily changing passwords. When a password is provided on edit, confirmation is still required for safety.

All tests pass successfully, confirming that the core CRUD functionality works as expected and is ready for the email workflows and protection logic to be added in subsequent task groups.
