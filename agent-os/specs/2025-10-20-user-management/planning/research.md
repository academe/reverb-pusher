# Codebase Analysis for User Management Feature

## Current Authentication Setup

### Existing Infrastructure
- **Laravel Breeze**: The application uses Laravel Breeze for authentication
- **User Model**: Located at `app/Models/User.php`
  - Implements `FilamentUser` interface
  - Has basic fields: name, email, password, email_verified_at, remember_token
  - `canAccessPanel()` returns true for all users (no role-based access control currently)
- **Database**: MySQL with standard users, password_reset_tokens, and sessions tables
- **Registration**: Currently DISABLED in `routes/auth.php` (lines 15-19 commented out)
- **Profile Management**: Exists at `/profile` via `ProfileController`
  - Edit profile (name, email)
  - Update password
  - Delete account

### Filament Admin Panel
- **Version**: Filament 3.3
- **Panel Location**: `app/Filament/Admin/`
- **Current Resources**: Only `ReverbAppResource` exists
  - Well-structured with form sections (App Details, Credentials, Configuration)
  - Uses TextInput, Textarea, Toggle, TagsInput components
  - Has List, Create, View, Edit pages
  - Includes actions like View, Edit, Delete
  - Copyable fields for credentials

### No Existing Artisan Commands
- No custom artisan commands found in `app/Console/Commands/` (directory doesn't exist)
- Will need to create directory and initial user creation command

### Authorization/Permissions
- **None currently implemented**
- No roles, permissions, or policies in place
- All authenticated users have full admin panel access

### Related Features
- ReverbAppResource serves as an excellent reference for:
  - Filament resource structure
  - Form layout patterns (using Sections)
  - Table configuration with actions
  - Navigation setup

## Key Findings

1. **Clean Slate for User Management**: No existing user management UI in Filament admin panel
2. **Breeze Foundation**: Laravel Breeze provides solid authentication foundation with login, password reset, email verification
3. **Simple Access Model**: Currently binary (authenticated = full access), which aligns with roadmap note "all users are admins"
4. **ReverbAppResource Pattern**: Can be replicated for UserResource structure
5. **No Multi-Factor Auth**: Not currently implemented
6. **No Activity Tracking**: No audit logs or user activity tracking exists

## Questions to Clarify

Based on this analysis, I need to clarify:
1. Artisan command specifics for creating first admin user
2. User management UI requirements within Filament panel
3. User invitation/creation workflow from within the app
4. Self-deletion prevention mechanism details
5. Profile management integration (use existing ProfileController or build into Filament?)
6. Password reset workflow (use existing Breeze or customize?)
7. Email verification requirements
8. User listing and filtering needs
9. Any future-proofing for roles (even if not implemented now)
