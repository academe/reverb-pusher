## 3. Roadmap Updates

**Status:** ✅ Updated

### Updated Roadmap Items

- [x] Item 3: **User Management System** - Marked as complete in `agent-os/product/roadmap.md`

### Notes

The roadmap item has been updated to reflect completion. The implementation matches the refined scope (user management without role-based access control). The roadmap notes correctly indicate that all users are admins at this stage and users cannot delete themselves.

## 4. Test Suite Results

**Status:** ⚠️ Some Failures (Unrelated to User Management)

### Test Summary

- **Total Tests:** 36 tests
- **Passing:** 34 tests (33 user management + 1 auth test)
- **Failing:** 2 tests (both unrelated to user management)
- **Errors:** 0

### User Management Test Results

All 33 user management tests are passing:

**UserActiveStatusTest (5 tests):**
- ✅ canAccessPanel returns false when user is inactive
- ✅ canAccessPanel returns true when user is active
- ✅ active status is cast to boolean
- ✅ active defaults to true for new users
- ✅ active column is fillable

**UserResourceTest (4 tests):**
- ✅ user can be created with required fields
- ✅ user can be updated
- ✅ user can be deleted
- ✅ email must be unique

**UserEmailWorkflowTest (4 tests):**
- ✅ invitation email sent when creating user without password
- ✅ no email sent when creating user with password
- ✅ password reset email sent from action button
- ✅ password reset link is valid

**UserProtectionTest (8 tests):**
- ✅ it prevents self deletion via policy
- ✅ it prevents deletion of last active user via policy
- ✅ it allows deletion when multiple active users exist via policy
- ✅ is last active user helper works correctly
- ✅ edit page prevents self deactivation
- ✅ edit page prevents last active user deactivation
- ✅ edit page allows deactivation when multiple active users exist
- ✅ active toggle is disabled for own record

**ProfileConsolidationTest (2 tests):**
- ✅ users can edit own profile via filament
- ✅ filament user menu remains functional

**UserManagementIntegrationTest (9 tests):**
- ✅ complete user invitation workflow
- ✅ admin password change allows user login
- ✅ active status controls panel access integration
- ✅ bulk delete respects protection rules
- ✅ password reset email token is valid and usable
- ✅ inactive user cannot access panel via middleware
- ✅ email uniqueness enforced on create and update
- ✅ password confirmation mismatch shows validation error
- ✅ last user protection works with multiple deactivations

**Auth Test (1 test):**
- ✅ users can not authenticate with invalid password

### Failed Tests

The 2 failed tests are NOT related to the User Management feature:

1. **Tests\Feature\Auth\AuthenticationTest > users can authenticate using the login screen**
   - Reason: Test expects redirect to `/dashboard` route but application now redirects to `/admin`
   - This is an expected change due to Filament implementation
   - Not a user management bug - just an outdated test expectation

2. **Tests\Feature\Auth\RegistrationTest > new users can register**
   - Reason: Registration functionality has been disabled as per project requirements
   - This is intentional behavior (see `.env.example` noting registration is disabled)
   - Not a user management bug - registration is managed through admin panel now

### Notes

The failed tests are pre-existing authentication tests from Laravel Breeze that are now outdated due to architectural changes (Filament admin panel and disabled public registration). These failures are expected and do not indicate any problems with the User Management implementation.

**All 33 user management tests pass successfully**, covering:
- Database layer and model behavior
- CRUD operations through Filament
- Email invitation and password reset workflows
- Self-protection and last-user protection logic
- Profile consolidation
- End-to-end integration scenarios

No regressions have been introduced to the user management functionality.

## Conclusion

**VERIFICATION PASSED**

The User Management feature implementation is complete and successful. All acceptance criteria have been met:

1. ✅ UserResource exists in Filament admin panel with List, Create, Edit pages
2. ✅ User creation works with all required fields and validation
3. ✅ Invitation emails send automatically when creating users without passwords
4. ✅ Password management works with direct reset and email actions
5. ✅ Self-protection prevents admins from deleting/deactivating themselves
6. ✅ Last user protection prevents deletion/deactivation of last active user
7. ✅ Active status controls panel access via canAccessPanel()
8. ✅ Breeze profile routes and components removed
9. ✅ Database migration applied successfully
10. ✅ UI consistency maintained with ReverbAppResource patterns
11. ✅ All 33 user management tests pass
12. ✅ No regressions in user management functionality

The implementation demonstrates high quality code, comprehensive test coverage, excellent documentation, and adherence to all specification requirements. The feature is production-ready.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Update or remove the 2 failing authentication tests (optional cleanup)
2. Consider the user management feature complete and move to next roadmap item
