# Product Mission

## Pitch
Reverb Pusher is a self-hosted WebSocket server that helps product developers and software architects manage real-time communication across multiple applications by providing centralized, cost-effective WebSocket infrastructure with Pusher protocol compatibility.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **Product Developers**: Engineers building applications that require real-time features like live updates, notifications, and collaborative functionality
- **Software Architects**: Technical leaders designing scalable, maintainable systems with proper separation of concerns

### User Personas

**Independent Developer** (25-45)
- **Role:** Full-stack developer building multiple web/mobile applications
- **Context:** Managing several projects that need real-time features, conscious of infrastructure costs
- **Pain Points:** Paying for multiple Pusher subscriptions, struggling with WebSocket configuration across different apps
- **Goals:** Reduce hosting costs, centralize WebSocket management, maintain reliable real-time features

**Technical Architect** (30-50)
- **Role:** Lead architect or engineering manager at a software company
- **Context:** Overseeing multiple products with shared infrastructure needs
- **Pain Points:** Vendor lock-in, unpredictable scaling costs, lack of control over critical infrastructure
- **Goals:** Own critical infrastructure, ensure reliability, achieve separation of concerns, reduce operational costs

## The Problem

### Expensive and Fragmented WebSocket Infrastructure
Developers building multiple applications with real-time features face significant costs using hosted services like Pusher, often paying separately for each application. Additionally, tightly coupling WebSocket servers with individual applications creates maintenance challenges and prevents code reuse. This results in redundant infrastructure spending and architectural complexity.

**Our Solution:** A centralized, self-hosted WebSocket server that manages multiple applications from a single instance, providing Pusher protocol compatibility while maintaining clean separation of concerns and eliminating per-app subscription costs.

## Differentiators

### Self-Hosted Control with Pusher Compatibility
Unlike hosted services like Pusher or Ably, we provide complete infrastructure ownership while maintaining protocol compatibility. This means you can migrate from Pusher without changing client code, gain full control over your WebSocket infrastructure, and eliminate recurring subscription costs. The result is significant cost savings and freedom from vendor lock-in.

### Centralized Multi-App Management
Unlike running separate WebSocket servers for each application, we provide a unified admin interface (Filament panel) for managing credentials, origins, and configurations across all your apps. This enables efficient management at scale while maintaining proper separation between the WebSocket server and consuming applications.

### Built on Proven Laravel Stack
Unlike custom WebSocket solutions that require specialized knowledge, we leverage Laravel 12 and Laravel Reverb - battle-tested technologies that Laravel developers already know. This reduces learning curve, simplifies deployment, and ensures compatibility with standard Laravel hosting environments like Forge.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Database-Driven Multi-App Configuration:** Manage multiple WebSocket applications from a single server instance, each with isolated credentials and settings stored in your database
- **Pusher Protocol Compatibility:** Drop-in replacement for Pusher with compatible API, allowing seamless migration of existing applications
- **Auto-Generated Credentials:** Secure app_id, app_key, and app_secret generation for each registered application
- **Automatic Server Restart:** WebSocket server automatically restarts when configuration changes are made, ensuring zero-downtime updates

### Management Features
- **Filament Admin Panel:** Intuitive web interface for creating, configuring, and managing WebSocket applications
- **Active/Inactive Toggling:** Enable or disable WebSocket apps without deleting configurations
- **CORS Origin Management:** Configure allowed origins per application for secure cross-domain WebSocket connections
- **Centralized Credential Storage:** All application credentials stored securely in a single database

### Advanced Features (Planned)
- **User Management:** Role-based access control for team collaboration on WebSocket management
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging and real-time monitoring to simplify setup and troubleshooting
- **Connection Statistics:** Track active connections, message throughput, and performance metrics per application
- **Webhooks:** Event notifications for connection lifecycle and custom events

## Core Values

### Reliability First
Uptime and stability are non-negotiable. The WebSocket server must be dependable infrastructure that applications can trust.

### Ease of Use
Setup and management should be straightforward for developers familiar with Laravel. Complex configuration is the enemy of adoption.

### Open Source
This is free software that anyone can use, modify, and deploy for their own needs. Community contributions strengthen the product.

### Separation of Concerns
The WebSocket server runs independently from consuming applications, promoting clean architecture and maintainable systems.

### Cost Efficiency
Self-hosting eliminates recurring subscription fees and unpredictable scaling costs from hosted services.

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Uptime:** 99.9%+ availability for WebSocket connections
- **Setup Time:** New users can configure their first app within 10 minutes
- **Reliability:** Zero data loss on connection drops with proper reconnection handling

### Secondary Metrics (To Be Confirmed)
- **Cost Savings:** Measurable reduction in infrastructure costs vs. hosted Pusher
- **Adoption:** Number of applications managed per server instance
- **Community Growth:** GitHub stars, forks, and community contributions
- **Performance:** Connection handling capacity and message latency
